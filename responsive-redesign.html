    <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p>
      For this project, I redesigned a website for a local yoga business in
      Providence, RI. I wanted to help redesign a website that had glaring
      usability issues
      <br />
      <br />
      <a href="https://www.jala-studio.com/">Jala Studio</a>
    </p>
    <div class="image-container">
      <img src="assets/responsive-redesign-img/JalaStudioOriginal.png" />
      </div>
    

    At first, I solely chose this website because I noticed numerous glaring
    accessibility issues with the homepage like responsiveness and low contrast.
    Upon closer examination using different tools however, I soon discovered
    other glaring issues:
    <h3 Finding Problems></h3>
    <p>
      1. Users need to understand how to toggle on dropdown menus in order to
      access the schedule for yoga events. This may not be intuitive especially
      because of the very low contrast of the dropdown menu bar.
      <br />
      2. The dropdown menu bar is also not apparent to be clickable, affecting
      the learnability of the site.
      <br />
      3. The traits of the dropdown menus are different in that not all lead to
      a different site while a couple do. However, all minus the “home” have a
      dropdown. This affects both the memorability and efficiency of the site.
      <br />
      4. To be able to purchase artwork or a gift certificate, the issue
      persists of not being able to distinguish whether text is clickable or
      not. Users have to hover over all text to figure out which words link to
      relevant parts of the site which affects the learnability of the site.
    </p>
    <h3 Accessibility></h3>
    As expected, WebAIM detected glaring contrast issues with the site. Most of the text on the home webpage has very low contrast against the white background site. Additionally, the tool detected a missing heading and empty and redundant links.  I also noticed the redundancy of one of the clickable elements but I was not aware of the missing headings. I agree with the low contrast errors because this was one of the main issues that caused me to choose this site to redesign.
    <div class="image-container">
      <img src="assets/responsive-redesign-img/Screen Shot 2024-05-09 at 10.38.07 PM.png" />
      </div>
    
    <br />
    <br />
    <h2>Process</h2>
    In order to begin thinking of a possible redesign, I turned to speed sketching to develop varying responsive iterations on how this website could change to solve the issues I found. 

    <div class="image-container">
      <img src="assets/responsive-redesign-img/speedsketches.png" />
      </div>

    I created several low-fi wireframes for desktop, mobile, and tablet on paper and then switched to figma to create these versions
    pics
    <div class="image-container">
      <img src="assets/responsive-redesign-img/Low-fi Desktop.png" />
      <img src="assets/responsive-redesign-img/Low-fi mobile.png" />
      <img src="assets/responsive-redesign-img/Low-fi tablet.png" />
      </div>

    I then landed on final sketches which I then turned into figma files to begin prototyping a fresh, new, and responsive homepage 
    <div class="image-container">
      <img src="assets/responsive-redesign-img/Hi-fi Desktop.png" />
      <img src="assets/responsive-redesign-img/Hi-fi Mobile.png" />
      <img src="assets/responsive-redesign-img/Hi-fi Tablet.png" />
      </div>

    <br />
   
 
  

    <br />
    <br />
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>
        Finally, utilizing a style guide that kept some of the original websites style choices, I deployed this final responsive redesign for the Jala Studio website. In the end, I made some necessary choices to change fonts and colors to fix the glaring low-contrast issues. I also removed parts of the original homepage.
